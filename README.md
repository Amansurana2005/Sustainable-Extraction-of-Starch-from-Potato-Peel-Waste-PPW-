# Sustainable-Extraction-of-Starch-from-Potato-Peel-Waste-PPW-

As part of my Energy and Environment minor coursework, I undertook a project on the Sustainable Extraction of Starch from Potato Peel Waste (PPW), aiming to transform agro-industrial waste into valuable resources through green process engineering.

The project focused on extracting starch using an eco-efficient alkaline hydrolysis method, where potato peel waste was treated with NaOH solutions of varying concentrations (0.1N–1.0N). Following mechanical pre-processing (grinding, drying), the workflow involved:

- Alkaline treatment of PPW to break down structural barriers.

- Sedimentation and filtration to isolate starch granules.

- Ethanol precipitation to further purify the starch extract.

- Quantitative analysis through DNS (3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid) assay and spectrophotometric measurements at 540 nm to assess reducing sugar concentrations.

Through systematic experimentation, we determined that 0.8N NaOH was the optimal concentration, achieving:

- Starch extraction yields of 12–15% (relative to initial wet peel weight).

- Peak reducing sugar concentration of 4.1%, validating efficient carbohydrate release.

- Negligible effect of homogenization on absorbance or extraction efficiency, highlighting the robustness of the baseline method.

The entire process was designed with sustainability in mind, incorporating water recycling, low chemical load, and minimal energy inputs, aligned with circular economy principles. The quality analysis showed that the recovered starch exhibited comparable characteristics to commercial-grade starch, suggesting potential applications in bio-materials and bio-energy sectors.
